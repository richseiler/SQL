# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project
This was a Data Analysis project performed in SQL as part of the Career Foundry Data Analytics program.
## Objective
You've been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth's business inteligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries. Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster's data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then you'll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
